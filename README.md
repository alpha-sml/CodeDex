## 📘 Overview

Competitive programmers use multiple platforms to solve problems and join contests — but tracking progress on each one separately is tedious.  
**CodeDex** simplifies this by aggregating **user stats, ratings, and achievements** from platforms like **LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank** into a unified, visually rich dashboard.
